// Shared process-wide caching device allocator (DevicePool) — extracted VERBATIM
// from the Qwen3.6 forward (qwen3_5.cpp) so the dense Qwen3 forward (qwen3.cpp)
// reuses the SAME pooled-scratch machinery instead of raw per-op Backend
// Alloc/Free. This is a pure relocation: the class body, the Pool()/AuxPool()
// singletons, and the thread-local ActivePool()/ActivePoolScope are byte-for-byte
// the qwen3_5.cpp definitions, so the 27B/35B gate-model behavior is unchanged
// (the header is included by qwen3_5.cpp in place of its old inline copies).
//
// Rationale: both cudaMalloc AND cudaFree SYNCHRONIZE the whole device, so the
// per-op DBuf alloc/free churn in a forward (thousands of tiny scratch buffers per
// step) is itself a sync storm. This pool reuses freed blocks (size-class keyed)
// instead of hitting cudaMalloc/cudaFree, so after a brief warm-up almost every
// DBuf lifetime is sync-free. Reuse is safe under the forward's single-queue
// (single-stream) ordering: a block returned to the pool is only handed back out
// on the same queue, and CUDA stream ordering guarantees the op that last touched
// the block has completed before any reused op runs — no host sync needed. Blocks
// are never returned to the driver (leak at process exit, like the cublasLt
// workspace); the pool is bounded by the forward's peak concurrent scratch. The
// pool is backend-agnostic (CPU malloc/free too — a harmless bounded cache there).

// SIZE-CLASS BUCKETING (prefill sync-cudaMalloc kill). Keying the pool on the
// EXACT byte size defeats reuse during prefill: under continuous batching each
// engine step processes a different token count T (prefill-chunk tokens + decode
// tokens), so every [T,*] scratch is a byte size that step-1 never saw — an
// exact-key MISS -> a SYNCHRONOUS cudaMalloc (device-serializing, does NOT
// overlap compute) on the forward's host thread, thousands per prefill. Rounding
// the request UP to a size class (keep the top `kClassBits` significant bits;
// <=1/2^kClassBits ~ 6.25% over-allocation) makes nearby-T scratch of the same
// op share ONE block, so after warm-up almost every prefill DBuf is a pool hit.
// The returned block is >= the requested bytes (the Tensor view uses only the
// logical prefix), and Put/Get round identically so a block always returns to
// its own class bucket. VT_POOL_EXACT=1 restores exact keying (A/B measurement).

// stream ordering guarantees the block's last op has completed before any reuse.
// Two streams sharing one pool BREAKS that invariant — a scratch block the aux
// stream freed (e.g. the shared gate/up transient) could be handed to a routed
// GEMM on the main stream and written WHILE the aux kernel still reads it (a
// cross-stream RAW/WAR race compute-sanitizer flags). vLLM sidesteps this with
// its STREAM-AWARE caching allocator (record_stream); we keep the simple pool and
// instead give the aux stream its OWN pool. Each pool then only ever serves ONE
// stream, so single-stream ordering holds within it and the two streams never
// share a live block. Blocks are handed back to the pool they came from (DBuf
// stores its owning pool), so a buffer allocated in the aux region and destroyed
