# BUILD-TRITON-DEFAULT-ON (#219) — the resolved default of VLLM_CPP_TRITON.
#
# `vt_triton_aot_computed_default` is the whole rule, kept pure so this matrix
# runs under `cmake -P` with no compiler, no CUDA and no GPU (exactly like
# TritonAOTMultiArchTest.cmake). The configure-level cells that this cannot
# reach — a real CUDA configure resolving the option, and the fat build still
# configuring clean — are proven on the gate host and recorded in the row's
# spec.
#
# Scratch fixtures live under a unique temporary root OUTSIDE the checkout:
# `cmake -P` sets CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR to the invoker's cwd, which under CI
# is the repository root. `_expect` also RECORDS failures instead of raising
# them, so the run always reaches its own cleanup and always reports every
# failing cell rather than only the first one; the single FATAL_ERROR comes
# after the fixtures are gone.

# artifact whose bytes drift from its MANIFEST hash (:602-625) and on a
# triton_kernels/*.py edited since regeneration (:627-664). Each cell below
# reproduces exactly one of those, on a fixture that is otherwise VALID, so the
# single mutation is what declines it.
#
# `_synth_fixture` writes a self-contained source root (its own copies of
# triton_kernels/*.py and scripts/triton-aot-compile.py) plus a minimal but
# fully consistent tree per arch. Cell "synth-valid" pins that the unmutated
