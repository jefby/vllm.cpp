"""GATE-PIN-UNPINNED-SNAPSHOTS (#471) — no NEW unpinned checkpoint resolution.

A gate that resolves its checkpoint by enumerating `<repo>/snapshots/` measures
whichever revision readdir happens to yield first. That is a property of the box,
not of the gate. `unsloth/Qwen3.6-27B-NVFP4` caches two materially different
models under one repo name, so the failure mode is not hypothetical.

The fix is `parity::HfSnapshot` in tests/parity/hf_snapshot.h, which names the
revision and returns "" — the caller's loud skip — when the cache holds a
different one.

This checker fails on any unpinned resolution that is not in LEDGER below.

WHAT IT GUARANTEES, EXACTLY. Read this before citing it; the first version of
this file claimed more than it delivered.

  * IT IS A LEXICAL CHECKER. It matches normalized source text. It does not
    parse C++ or Python, does not resolve types, and does not follow a value
    across a file boundary. A resolution assembled in one file and enumerated in
    another is NOT caught.
  * WHAT IT MODELS is a *class*, not one idiom: any of the enumerators in
    `ENUMERATORS` (`directory_iterator`, `recursive_directory_iterator`,
    `opendir`, `scandir`, `readdir`, `listdir`, `iterdir`, `walk`, `glob`,
    `iglob`, `rglob`) whose call text — receiver chain, name and *balanced*
    argument list, so line wrapping is irrelevant — mentions an HF-cache marker
    (`CACHE_MARKERS`) or names a value this file bound to one. Binding is
    followed to a fixpoint through assignments, through struct members, and
    through a helper that RETURNS the path, so renaming the variable or hiding
    the literal behind a `constexpr` does not evade it.
  * SCOPE IS BY ROOT AND SUFFIX: `SCAN_ROOTS` x `SCANNED_SUFFIXES`. `src/` is
    deliberately NOT scanned — `src/vllm/entrypoints/model_loader.cpp` resolves a
    user's cache at run time, which is the product working, not a gate choosing
    its own subject. `examples/` likewise.
  * IT IS DEFEATABLE ON PURPOSE. Shelling out to `find`, reading a path from an
    environment variable whose name carries no marker, or a `#define`d enumerator
    all evade it. It raises the cost of the ACCIDENT — the ordinary
    copy-paste that reintroduces readdir-order resolution — and it is not an
    adversarial control.

  * THE SELF-TEST (`--self-test`) sweeps the `FIXTURES` corpus below, in BOTH
    directions: every `unpinned=True` idiom must be reported and every
    `unpinned=False` one must not. That is what makes "the checker cannot be
    greened by narrowing its own pattern" a testable claim rather than an
    assertion — but THE CLAIM IS BOUNDED BY THE CORPUS, and the bound is the
    honest part of it.

    What is mechanically guaranteed, one branch at a time: dropping any single
    entry of `ENUMERATORS`, or any single entry of `CACHE_MARKERS`, stops at
    least one positive fixture being reported. That is not asserted here, it is
    PERFORMED — tests/scripts/test_check_snapshot_pins.py
    ::test_narrowing_any_single_branch_drops_a_positive_fixture carries out each
    drop and fails if the corpus shrugs it off. Adding an enumerator or a marker
    without a fixture that isolates it is RED there, so the two lists cannot
    outgrow their coverage.

    What is NOT guaranteed: every other narrowing — the `fs::` spelling, the
    scanned roots, the scanned suffixes, the subject-binding rule — is covered
    only in so far as some fixture happens to exercise it, and an idiom nobody
    wrote a fixture for is not covered by the claim at all. The first version of
    this file said "a mutation to any single branch lands on one of them"
    without that bound; four single-branch narrowings then passed it.

ON THE LEDGER. It exists because the files listed in LEDGER cannot be pinned
today: their goldens record no revision at all (19 `*_greedy*` corpora have no
manifest file whatsoever), and pinning to "whatever is cached here" is the defect
wearing a constant's name. #472 owes the re-capture. The last five entries are
`scripts/` staging and reference-dump helpers rather than gates — they FEED
goldens instead of asserting them, which is the same hazard one step upstream.
Every line is a debt:

  * DELETING a line is the work. The STALE check makes it a one-way ratchet: once
    a file is pinned, its ledger line MUST go or the checker fails.
  * ADDING a line is a review event and needs an argument in the commit message
    that excuses it, per the no-waiver-registry rule in AGENTS.md. That argument
    IS the control, and it is deliberately the only one: a machine-checkable
    admission test would be a waiver registry with extra steps, which AGENTS.md
    forbids. `check_ledger_shape` therefore enforces only what is mechanical —
    a non-empty reason naming a tracking issue — and the question of whether the
    debt is legitimate stays with the reviewer who reads the diff.

The ledger is written only when an unpinned resolver is added or removed, never
by every PR, so it is not the shared-lock shape AGENTS.md forbids.
