"""Fail if an example reaches past the public ABI/library surface into internal headers.

The target invariant (developer-directed 2026-08-07): **`examples/*` are THIN CLIENTS
of the public surface, never of internal headers.** A capability must be usable through
the packaged library the way a downstream consumer uses it — the flat C ABI
(`include/vllm.h`), which is the ONLY header `make install` ships
(`CMakeLists.txt:1757` `install(FILES include/vllm.h ...)`; the packaged `vllm_shared`
PUBLIC-includes exactly that one header and is version-scripted to export only the
`vllm_*` C ABI, `CMakeLists.txt:1712-1730`). An example that instead `#include`s the
internal C++ tree (`vllm/...`, `vt/...`, `src/...`) is coupling to engine internals: it
proves the capability is reachable ONLY by re-implementing against private headers, the
"CLI-only capability" anti-pattern this project keeps rediscovering per model (Laguna
keep-quant decode via `laguna-gen`, DeepSeek-V4 via `deepseek-v4-gen`, the ENTIRE
MiniMax-H3 diffusion pipeline via `minimax-h3-gen`, Kimi-Linear's paged-incremental
decode). The remedy is never to keep a parallel CLI implementation; it is to grow the
public ABI so the example can be a client.

This is the STRUCTURAL, lint-able half of the surface-coverage audit
(`.agents/specs/surface-coverage-2026-08-07.md`). It is deliberately a coarse FLOOR,
like check-fusion-consistency.py / check-runner-routing-consistency.py. It has TWO axes.

Axis 1 — EXAMPLE INCLUDE BOUNDARY (structural): whether each example is a public-surface
client or an internal-reacher, so a new CLI-only model driver cannot land silently.

Axis 2 — C-ABI CAPABILITY REACHABILITY (advertised vs real): every capability the public
FEATURES page advertises must EITHER name a C-ABI entry point that actually exists in
include/vllm.h, OR be an explicit embedder-unreachable row backed by a fold-tracked
allowlist entry. This makes "the flat C ABI is the ONE way an embedder reaches a
capability" a checked property, not a hope.

Three checks, all mutation-testable via pure functions:

(1) **PUBLIC SURFACE DERIVED + PINNED.** The public header set is DERIVED from
    `CMakeLists.txt`'s `install(FILES ...)` rules (`public_headers_from_cmake`), not
    hardcoded — that is the source of truth for what a downstream consumer gets. It is
    checked against the pinned `EXPECTED_PUBLIC` so a change to the installed/exported
    surface reds until re-derived; the boundary can never drift out from under the lint.

(2) **EXAMPLE INCLUDE BOUNDARY (axis 1).** Every top-level unit under `examples/` (one
    per immediate subdirectory) that `#include`s an internal header MUST carry an entry in
    scripts/example-abi-allowlist.txt — the TRANSITION TRACKER: each entry names the fold
    row that will grow the ABI capability and rewrite the example as a client (order:
    grow the ABI entry point, rewrite the example against `vllm.h`, delete the parallel
    implementation). There are NO permanent exemptions — dev/diagnostic tools are tracked
    too. A NEW internal-reaching example with no entry reds the gate. The converse is
    enforced too: an allowlisted unit that no longer reaches internal headers (folded, now
    a clean ABI client) is a STALE entry and reds — removing it is the enforcement gate
    closing, exactly like the runner-routing allowlist. A shrink-only ratchet
    (`MAX_INTERNAL_REACHING`) caps the count of internal-reachers so it can only fall as
    folds land: a new one cannot be admitted without consciously raising the ceiling.
    `examples/cli` (the `vllm-cli` reference client — `#include "vllm.h"` only) is the
    clean baseline and must NEVER be allowlisted.

(3) **C-ABI CAPABILITY REACHABILITY (axis 2).** The marked abi-capability-table in
    docs/FEATURES.md is bound to include/vllm.h: a `reachable` row must name at least one
    C-ABI symbol that EXISTS in the header (an aspirational ABI claim reds); an
    `embedder-unreachable` row must name no live surface and carry a fold-tracked entry in
    scripts/abi-capability-allowlist.txt (a CLI/server-only capability that is not tracked
    reds). A stale allowlist entry (matching no embedder-unreachable row) reds.

The validation logic is pure functions (`internal_includes_by_unit`, `parse_allowlist`,
`boundary_errors`, `public_surface_pinned`, `capability_table`, `capability_errors`) so it
is unit- and mutation-testable (tests/scripts/test_check_surface_coverage.py), mirroring
check-runner-routing-consistency.py. Per AGENTS.md, never weaken this checker to make an
internal-reaching example or an unreachable capability pass: grow the ABI + fold, or add a
conscious, reviewable allowlist entry with its fold row.
