# GATE-27B-FP8-TOWER-GOLDEN — a token gate the FP8 tower can actually fail

Issue: [#466](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/466)
Row: `GATE-27B-FP8-TOWER-GOLDEN`
Gate model (new arm): `nvidia/Qwen3.6-27B-NVFP4` @`0893e1606ff3d5f97a441f405d5fc541a6bdf404`
Gate model (existing arm, unchanged): `unsloth/Qwen3.6-27B-NVFP4` @`890bdef7a42feba6d83b6e17a03315c694112f2a`

## Scope

Add a SECOND checkpoint arm to the dense 27B greedy acceptance gate, pinned to
the `modelopt_mixed` checkpoint whose attention/GDN tower is FP8 W8A8, with its
own goldens captured from the pinned oracle.

**In scope:** a pinned resolver for `nvidia/Qwen3.6-27B-NVFP4`@`0893e160` in
`tests/parity/hf_snapshot.h`; goldens under
`tests/parity/goldens/qwen36_{embed,gdn_layer,fullattn_layer,norm,logits}_27n/`
(the paged-engine arm consumes `logits`; the other four are captured for the
op-parity follow-on); a new parity test that greedy-decodes
that checkpoint through the full paged engine and asserts the FP8 GDN
input-projection dispatch contract **unconditionally**; a skip that cannot be
read as coverage.

**Out of scope, recorded as owed:** wiring the new gate into
`tools/bench/online_gate.py::MODEL_GATE_CONTRACTS` so the `27n` performance key
stops recording a build-sanity precondition (needs a `27n` online-gate run to
validate, which this row does not take); pinning the three DFlash tests that
still resolve the unsloth 27B repo by unpinned `directory_iterator`; pinning the
four 35B tests likewise. Each is a separate row.

## The hole, VERIFIED not inferred

`tests/parity/hf_snapshot.h:31,59-62` resolves the dense 27B gate to
`unsloth/Qwen3.6-27B-NVFP4`@`890bdef7`. Every fp8-tower lever targets
`nvidia/Qwen3.6-27B-NVFP4`@`0893e160`. Read off the two cached snapshots on the
gate host:

| | `unsloth`@`890bdef7` | `nvidia`@`0893e160` |
|---|---|---|
| `quant_method` | `compressed-tensors`, `nvfp4-pack-quantized` | `modelopt_mixed` |
| MLP | NVFP4 **W4A4** (`input_activations.num_bits=4`, dynamic local) | `W4A16_NVFP4`, group 16 |
| `linear_attn.in_proj_{qkv,z,a,b}` | listed in `ignore` → **BF16** | `in_proj_qkv`, `in_proj_z` = **FP8** |
| `linear_attn.out_proj` | NVFP4 (`weight_packed`) | **FP8** |
| `self_attn.{q,k,v,o}_proj` | NVFP4 | **FP8** |
| `*.input_scale` tensors present | **0** | present |

The checkpoints are not two spellings of one model. On `@890bdef7` the FP8 tower
does not exist, so no amount of correctness pressure on the SACRED gate can reach
an fp8 code path.

The gate concedes this in place. `tests/parity/test_qwen27_paged_engine.cpp:227`
guards the entire FP8 dispatch-count contract on
`if (fp8_inproj.Total() != 0)`, and the comment above it states *"A BF16-owner
checkpoint issues neither and totals 0."* On the checkpoint this gate pins, that
predicate is always false: the contract never executes, prints nothing, and the
case still reports success. An unexercised contract that is indistinguishable
from a satisfied one is the defect this row closes.

`.agents/specs/cuda-online-serving-gate.md:89,101-106` already records the debt
in prose — `27n`'s correctness precondition is *"build sanity only, never a
golden for @0893e160"*, and a `27n` correctness claim *"owes a greedy
continuation against the pinned oracle on @0893e160 itself"*. This row is that
owed continuation.

## Design

### 1. Resolver

`tests/parity/hf_snapshot.h` gains `kQwen27nFp8TowerRevision` and
`Qwen27nFp8TowerSnapshot()`, built on the existing `HfSnapshot` helper so the
skip-not-substitute discipline is inherited unchanged: a cache holding some other
revision of the same repo returns `""` rather than being gated.

The constant is deliberately NOT named `kQwen27NvfP4Revision*`.
`tests/tools/test_online_gate_server_binary.py:613-628` asserts exactly one
`kQwen27NvfP4Revision` pin exists in the header and that it equals
`MODEL_GATE_CONTRACTS["test_qwen27_paged_engine"]["golden_revision"]`. That
assertion is correct and must keep passing untouched; a second pin under a
distinct name does not disturb it.

### 2. Goldens

Captured by the EXISTING recipe, `tools/parity/dump_qwen36.py`, with `--tag
27n`. Its MEASURED behaviour is unmodified; only the manifest's provenance
strings changed (see `## Outcome`), because the old hardcoded `detail` asserted a
weight layout that is false for this checkpoint. Same prompt (`"The capital of France is Paris, and the"`), same
`N_GREEDY = 16`, same `TOPK = 1000`, same `SamplingParams(temperature=0.0)`, same
`LLM(enforce_eager=True, max_model_len=256, max_num_seqs=1, dtype="bfloat16")`,
same manifest emitter. The engine config is load-bearing, not incidental:
`.agents/specs/pin-advance.md:456-474` shows the same oracle emits a different
tok6 under `max_model_len=8192, max_num_seqs=4` — config decides the near-tie,
not oracle version. Nothing about the capture is invented for this row.

Oracle: `~/venvs/vllm-oracle-next` asserted to report a version containing
`555967922` before the capture runs, and aborting otherwise. The canonical
`~/venvs/vllm-oracle` symlink currently points at
`~/venvs/vllm-oracle-v0.25.0-stage` — the ROLLBACK (issue #375) — so this row
addresses the oracle by its explicit path and never by the symlink.

No emulation sidecar. `greedy_ids_emulation.npy` exists on the `@890bdef7` arm
because that checkpoint has a documented W4A4 tok6 whitespace near-tie between
the production and emulation NVFP4 kernels;
`tools/parity/dump_27b_emulation_greedy.py` hardcodes `EXPECT_TOK6 = 271` for it.
`@0893e160` is W4A**16** with an FP8 tower — a different kernel set and a
different near-tie question — so importing that fixture would be asserting a
property nobody measured. The new arm therefore gates on `greedy_ids` alone and
records the absent negative control as a limitation.

### 3. The new arm

`tests/parity/test_qwen27n_fp8_tower_paged_engine.cpp`, a sibling of the existing
gate, NOT a replacement. `@890bdef7` keeps its goldens, its assertions, and its
proof line, byte for byte.

The new arm differs from its sibling in exactly the places the checkpoint differs:

- The FP8 GDN input-projection dispatch contract is asserted
  **unconditionally**. `Total() == 0` is a FAILURE here — it is the precise
  signature of gating a checkpoint with no FP8 tower, which is how this hole
  stayed open. That single inverted guard is the whole point of the row.
- Packed GDN decode must issue ZERO launches, asserted against the REAL
  predicate rather than `detail::PackedGdnDecodeEnvSelected`, which mirrors the
  ENV couplings only and would demand 48 here (#470).
- No `greedy_ids_emulation` comparison (§2).

### 4. A skip that cannot be mistaken for coverage

The sibling prints a `MESSAGE` and returns — the case then reports **success with
zero assertions**, and `ctest` exits 0. That is what let an absent instrument read
as a pass. The new arm's absent-checkpoint path:

- prints a banner naming the row, the repo, the exact revision, and the words
  `NO-FP8-TOWER-COVERAGE`, so the intent cannot be reconstructed as a pass by a
  reader skimming a log;
- records at least one assertion in the skip path, so a skipped run is
  distinguishable from a covered run by the assertion count alone, which is the
  signal a gate reader actually diffs;
- prints its proof line ONLY after tokens have been compared, mirroring the
  existing `MODEL_GATE_CONTRACTS` proof discipline.

## Gates

Focused: `ctest -R qwen27n_fp8_tower --output-on-failure -V`, on the dgx
production build (`-DVLLM_CPP_CUTLASS_DIR=$HOME/cutlass-4.5.0
-DVLLM_CPP_TRITON=ON -DVLLM_CPP_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=121a
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo`), which the gate itself refuses to run
without.

RED-before: the arm must FAIL under a mutation of the FP8 path it claims to
cover, proven by a changed assertion count and a non-zero exit — not by reading
the code. Restored byte-for-byte afterwards, verified by `git status` and a
`git diff --stat` that is empty.

The `@890bdef7` arm must remain at its established count in the same run, proving
the addition is additive.

## Risks

- **A near-tie on the new checkpoint.** If `@0893e160`'s greedy continuation sits
  on a tie the way `@890bdef7`'s tok6 does, the arm could be checkpoint-stable but
  build-sensitive. Mitigated by capturing with the same knobs the sibling uses and
  by recording the oracle's own continuation verbatim; a tie discovered later is a
  finding, not a reason to adjust a golden.
- **Unified-memory pressure.** GB10 memory is unified, so the capture's
  `gpu_memory_utilization` reserves HOST RAM. Capture and gate runs take the GPU
  mutex and never overlap another model job.

## Stop conditions

- The oracle cannot load `@0893e160` → STOP and report. Never substitute a
  different revision; that is the failure mode this row exists to close.
- The gate host's GPU lock is held by another agent's campaign → hand back rather
  than contend.

## Outcome

`DONE`. The hole was real and is closed. What was measured, what was rejected,
and what the arm still cannot see:

### Both arms, same production build, dgx (GB10 sm_121a)

`RelWithDebInfo`, `-DVLLM_CPP_CUTLASS_DIR=$HOME/cutlass-4.5.0
-DVLLM_CPP_TRITON=ON -DVLLM_CPP_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=121a`; configure log verified
to print `CUTLASS found … enabling sm120a NVFP4 cutlass GEMM`,
`FlashAttention-2 prefill/decode: ENABLED`, and the `sm_121a` Triton-AOT lines.
`ctest -j 1`, each arm alone, under `flock $HOME/gpu.lock`.

| run | `qwen3_5_weights.cpp` | 27n arm | 27b arm (SACRED) |
|---|---|---|---|
| base | pristine | 236 asserts, **SUCCESS** | 235 asserts, SUCCESS |
| mutant 1.02x | fp8 scale x1.02 | 236 asserts, SUCCESS | 235 asserts, SUCCESS |
| mutant 1.10x | fp8 scale x1.10 | 236 asserts, SUCCESS | 235 asserts, SUCCESS |
| **mutant 2.0x** | fp8 scale x2.0 | **236 asserts, 1 FAILED, ctest EXIT=8** | **235 asserts, SUCCESS** |
| restored | pristine, forced recompile | 236 asserts, SUCCESS | 235 asserts, SUCCESS |

The 2.0x row is the whole thesis in one binary. `LoadFp8RawShared` is the single
external-linkage seam through which every FP8 GDN in_proj / out_proj /
attention projection is loaded, and it is entered only for a projection whose
on-disk dtype is `F8_E4M3`. Under the mutation the 27n arm printed five
`[VT_RED_MUTATION]` reachability lines (layer 0 `in_proj_qkv`, `in_proj_z`,
`out_proj`) and failed on `CHECK(got == want_prod)`. The SACRED arm printed
**zero** — the mutated code was never called at all on its checkpoint — and
passed 235/235. An fp8 defect that the SACRED gate structurally cannot observe
is now observed.

### The arm's SENSITIVITY, honestly

A uniform **1.10x** perturbation of every FP8 weight scale and folded alpha is
REACHED (five reachability lines) and still emits the identical 16 tokens. So
this arm catches a gross fp8 defect and does NOT catch a ~10% per-tensor scale
error. It is a token gate on one short prompt, not a numerical-tolerance gate,
and it should never be quoted as if it bounded fp8 numerics.

The fix for that is already paid for: this row captured
`qwen36_{embed,gdn_layer,fullattn_layer,norm,logits}_27n` — per-tensor goldens
with `atol/rtol` 1e-3 to 5e-2 and top-1000 logits — and only the `logits`
directory is consumed so far. Giving `test_op_parity`'s Qwen27 arms a 27n
counterpart against the committed tensors would catch the 1.10x case. Owed,
not done here.

This bound no longer lives only in this spec. It is carried in the test file's
own header block and, so that it cannot be separated from the claim, in the
proof `MESSAGE` itself, which now reads `GROSS fp8-defect sensitivity ONLY`.
A proof line gets pasted into PR bodies; a caveat 200 lines into a spec does
not travel with it.

### The token stream does not discriminate the checkpoints

`@0893e160` and `@890bdef7` emit the SAME 16 greedy tokens on this prompt
(`[6511, 314, 9564, 369, 19241, 13, 198, 760, 6511, 314, 9338, 369, 11751, 11,
321, 279]`), and the same 9 prefill argmaxes. The token comparison alone would
therefore NOT notice a wrong-checkpoint run. Two things carry that instead, and
both are load-bearing rather than decorative: the revision-pinned resolver, and
the unconditional `Total() != 0` fp8 dispatch assertion — which is the only
thing in either arm that can tell the two checkpoints apart at runtime.

### Skip behaviour, measured not asserted

| invocation | assertions | status | exit |
|---|---|---|---|
| checkpoint present | 236 | SUCCESS | 0 |
| absent | **1** | SUCCESS | 0 |
| absent + `VT_REQUIRE_27N_FP8_GATE=1` | **0**, `test case THREW` | **FAILURE** | **1** |

All three print the `NO-FP8-TOWER-COVERAGE` banner naming the exact revision.

### Capture reproducibility

Captured twice from two independent oracle loads of
`0.23.1rc1.dev1511+g555967922` (identity asserted before each load). Every
`.npy` is byte-identical between the two runs; only `manifest.json` differs, by
the provenance fix below.

### Rejected / repaired along the way

- **`dump_qwen36.py`'s hardcoded `detail`.** It asserted "GDN in_proj, embed,
  norms, lm_head are bf16" — true of `@890bdef7`, FALSE of `@0893e160`. A
  manifest whose job is to say which model a golden belongs to must not state
  the wrong layout for the next checkpoint captured, so `detail` now records
  the engine-resolved `quantization` and `kv_cache_dtype`, and `--pin` records
  the oracle revision actually run instead of inheriting `e24d1b24`. Measured
  content, knobs and schema unchanged.
- **`detail::PackedGdnDecodeEnvSelected` is NOT used by this arm.** It mirrors
  the ENV couplings only; the real predicate additionally requires
  `in_proj_qkv_fp8.Empty()` (`qwen3_5.cpp:4161-4165`). On an fp8 tower the mirror
  would demand 48 packed launches where the truth is 0, so the sibling gate
  would throw for the wrong reason if ever pointed here via
  `VT_QWEN27_SNAPSHOT`. This arm pins the real behaviour (0) directly. The
  mirror's drift is filed as [#470](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/470).
- **Two harness traps hit and recorded, because both FAIL OPEN silently.**
  (1) `set -e` is disabled inside a function whose status is tested by `if`, so
  the first capture's checkpoint-identity guard printed its own failure message
  and carried on; the guard was re-run standalone afterwards and the checkpoint
  is confirmed (96 FP8 `linear_attn.in_proj`, 48 `out_proj`, 192 W4A16 MLP).
  (2) `shutil.copy2` restores the backup's ORIGINAL mtime, leaving the mutant
  object NEWER than the restored source: the first "restored" run silently
  re-used the mutant binary and reported GREEN. Caught by a reachability-line
  count, not by reading the code. Restoration was only accepted after a forced
  recompile and zero `[VT_RED_MUTATION]` lines.

### Owed, explicitly

- `tools/bench/online_gate.py::MODEL_GATE_CONTRACTS` still records
  `test_qwen27_paged_engine` as `27n`'s precondition, i.e. build sanity on a
  neighbour. Repointing it at this arm needs a `27n` online-gate run to
  validate and is a separate row.
- The three DFlash tests and the four 35B tests still resolve their snapshot by
  unpinned `directory_iterator`; the DFlash trio reads the very repo known to
  hold two revisions.
- 27n op-parity arms against the four other committed 27n golden directories.

The fresh review of the landed arm raised four more, all filed rather than
folded in, because each needs its own RED-before evidence:

| issue | what the arm still cannot do |
|---|---|
| [#476](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/476) | see an fp8→bf16 DEQUANT FALLBACK on `out_proj_fp8` or the four `self_attn.*_proj_fp8` — `GdnFp8InProjDebugStats` counts GDN `in_proj` only, and `6603356a` is that exact defect landing token-invisible |
| [#477](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/477) | reach a CI log at all: `ctest --output-on-failure` prints nothing for a passing skip, so all three refusal defences are silent there. Also tracks the `MODEL_GATE_CONTRACTS` debt above |
| [#478](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/478) | agree with itself: it refuses `PackedGdnDecodeEnvSelected` as an ENV-only mirror yet derives its expected counts from `MergedGdnFp8QkvzEnvSelected`, which is the same kind of mirror |
| [#479](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/479) | be audited from its own manifests, which label the pinned oracle `pip-vllm` |

§4's banner text was also corrected in place: it said `NO FP8 TOWER COVERAGE`
where the code emits `NO-FP8-TOWER-COVERAGE`, so a grep written from this spec
found nothing. The code is the authority.

## Now

`DONE` — arm landed with RED-mutation evidence; follow-ons above are separate
rows.
