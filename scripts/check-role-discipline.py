"""Feature code reaches main only through a reviewed row/* PR. (W1)

This is how "the operator drives features only via sub-agents" is enforced. It
deliberately does NOT try to detect who typed the code -- authorship is
self-asserted and unprovable. It enforces the PATH instead: feature code arrives
on `main` through a merged `row/<ROW-ID>` PR, whoever produced it. A sub-agent, a
helper session, or the developer all satisfy it the same way, and a direct push
of feature code does not.

Non-product paths are classified by closed lexical forms rather than exempting
whole mutable trees.  This checker still owns the feature-arrival rule; the PR
and size gates independently review the other classes.

ACTIVATION. ENFORCING since the cutover commit 44e8225cf (user-directed
2026-08-05). Every commit from that one ONWARD must land feature code through a
merged `row/*` PR; everything before it is exempt, because it was created under
the previous direct-push policy and rewriting that judgement retroactively would
redden honest history. The cutover itself is a records-only commit, so it passes.

What this changes in practice: feature paths (src/, include/, tests/, examples/,
cmake/, CMakeLists.txt) can no longer be pushed straight to main.

ARRIVAL IS JUDGED ONCE, ON THE COMMIT THAT LANDS THE CHANGE. A squash-merge
lands one commit carrying "(#N)". A real merge commit lands the merge plus the
branch commits it brings in; the merge is the arrival, and `merged_pr_content`
exempts the content underneath it rather than re-judging each branch commit on a
message that was never required to name the PR.

SECOND CUTOVER: WORKTREE_DISCIPLINE_SINCE (user-directed 2026-08-09). Integration
paths (scripts/, .agents/, docs/, .github/, AGENTS.md) USED to be pushable
straight to main, so the operator could fix a gate or repair a record without a
round trip. That exemption was also the one way work could legitimately happen
on the shared checkout, and it did: the checkout drifted 40 commits behind main
on a stale branch while ~150 orphaned worktrees filled the disk. AGENTS.md now
requires every unit of work to happen in its own worktree on its own task
branch, so from this second cutover onward EVERY tracked path must arrive via a
task branch -- a reviewed row/* PR, or an authorized local merge naming the
branch, which keeps the repair case one step. is_integration_path is retained
for pre-cutover history, which is honest under the rule it was made under.
