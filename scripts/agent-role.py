"""Declare, materialize and re-derive an agent session's role. (W0)

The role CANNOT be derived at session start: the common case is one operator and
several helpers all launched from the SAME checkout, indistinguishable until a
role has already been taken. So the role is DECLARED, immediately MATERIALIZED
into a fact, and only then re-derived. See
.agents/specs/operator-helper-protocol.md.

A role keys on the **worktree**, never on the session (user-directed correction,
2026-08-06):

* **worktree** - `git rev-parse --absolute-git-dir`, which is per-worktree
  (`.git/worktrees/<name>`), so a materialized helper is distinguishable from
  the primary checkout without any bookkeeping. The marker lives inside it, so
  one worktree is one role and that role survives a new shell, a new process
  and a lost environment.
* **session** - `VLLM_CPP_AGENT_SESSION` when set, else the parent process id.
  Recorded as PROVENANCE only, and nothing gates on it. An earlier version of
  this file called it "stable across tool calls within a session (measured)".
  That was DISPROVEN: at least one real harness gives every tool call a fresh
  shell and does not persist environment variables, so a role claimed in one
  call resolved as UNDECLARED in the next and `agent-preflight.sh` exited 1 --
  making a default-on role gate unpassable rather than strict, which is how a
  gate teaches people to disable it.

The accepted cost is explicit: two sessions sharing one checkout share a role.
Every unit of work takes its own worktree, so that case is rare and it is the
right trade. See .agents/specs/session-onboarding.md, "Correction: a role keys
on the WORKTREE, not the session".

The coordinator RECORDS live in the git COMMON dir, not the working tree: they
are shared by every worktree of the repo (the right scope for "who is
coordinating where") and can never be committed by accident.

They are a record and NEVER a refusal (user-directed, issue #285,
.agents/specs/operator-record.md). This file used to argue for one exclusive
operator per repo because "the shared case is the operator's primary checkout,
where one role is the correct answer anyway". That premise is gone: AGENTS.md
now requires EVERY unit of work to take its own worktree and to reach `main`
from a task branch, so there is no shared checkout to protect.

What an operator is, is a COORDINATOR. Its powers are merging PRs and
dispatching sub-agents into separate worktrees; it never rewrites shared
history, and `main` is never force-pushed. A plain `git push` therefore refuses
any non-fast-forward, so git itself is the interlock and concurrent
coordinators serialise on it -- the loser fetches, re-merges, re-gates and
pushes again. A JSON file in `.git/` never provided that guarantee and could
not. What it did provide was two hours of blocked coordination every time a
session died mid-flight, with no remedy but hand-deleting a file.

So the representation is one record per worktree,
`<git-common-dir>/vllm-cpp-operators/<sha256(worktree)[:16]>.json`, rather than
one shared file. A writer only ever touches the path derived from its OWN
worktree -- the identity ownership already keys on -- so two claimants racing
write two different paths and neither can lose the other's record. Each publish
is `write temp + os.replace` in the same directory, which is atomic on POSIX, so
a reader sees the old record or the new one, never half of one. There is no
read-modify-write of a shared file anywhere here, which is exactly what a single
JSON array or an append log would have needed to release or prune.
