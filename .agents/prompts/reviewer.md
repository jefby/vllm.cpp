- `REV-WORKTREE` | forbidden | Mutate the reviewed worktree, index, HEAD, or branch.
- `REV-FINDINGS` | evidence | List findings first in severity-descending order with severity, path:line, evidence, violated rule or requirement, and required remediation.

## Required output
- findings: NONE | LIST[severity,path:line,evidence,violated_rule_or_requirement,required_remediation]; ORDER=severity_descending
- verdict: PASS | FAIL
- static_review: EVIDENCE
- mutation_evidence: EVIDENCE
- full_gate: EVIDENCE
- remaining_concern: EVIDENCE | NONE

## Stop conditions
- `STOP-SCRATCH` | FAIL | A safe scratch mutation environment cannot be created.
